# Branding

Branding the look and feel
The look and feel of The Identity Hub can be branded on different levels:

- global (cross tenant)
- tenant specific

Next to this, views and partial views can also be localized.
Based on the level the files should be placed in a certain folder and/or follow a specific naming convention.
Files can be centralized either within the folder structure of The Identity Hub or on a file share.
